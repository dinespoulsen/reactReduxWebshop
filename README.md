## Introduction

The reactReduxWebshop project is a webshop based on the idea of making a simple webshop that integrates the technologies React and Redux. We wanted to increase our knowledge in these technologies and build something fun and with a good user experience. The application has been developed with a focus on test driven development and the SOLID principles have been applied to our best ability. The Redux store will be fed with data about the products from a static file. The focus will therefore only be on the user experience and how the user will interact with the webshop and the shopping cart.
